# Knowledge-Distillation-for-On-device-Audio-Classification


The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred an urgent need for innovative approaches to detect and combat the virus. As researchers and healthcare professionals explore diverse avenues for early identification of potential cases, the analysis of audio data, particularly cough sounds, has emerged as a promising frontier. 
Coughing is a common symptom associated with respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19, making it a valuable signal for early detection. In this context, machine learning models, especially those based on audio classification, have proven effective in deciphering patterns indicative of various medical conditions. 
The wav2vec2 model, a state-of-the-art architecture for speech and audio processing, has demonstrated remarkable performance in capturing intricate details within audio data. However, the deployment of such models in real-world scenarios, especially in resource-constrained environments or on-device applications, poses significant challenges. 
Large model sizes demand substantial computational resources, hindering their implementation on edge devices. This issue has motivated our project â€“ to develop a more compact version of the wav2vec2 model tailored for on-device audio classification, with a specific focus on identifying COVID-19 cases based on cough data.


By harnessing the principles of knowledge distillation, we aim to transfer the knowledge encoded in the comprehensive wav2vec2 model to a more lightweight counterpart, facilitating efficient ondevice processing. 
The motivation behind this endeavor is twofold: first, to democratize access to COVID-19 detection tools, allowing for widespread use even in remote or resource-limited areas, and second, to pave the way for real-time, on-device audio classification, enabling quicker response times and reducing dependence on centralized infrastructure. 
This project not only addresses a critical need in the ongoing battle against the pandemic but also contributes to the broader field of machine learning by exploring methodologies for model compression and deployment in real-world, healthcare applications. 
Through this initiative, we strive to bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical, on-the-ground solutions, ultimately advancing the capabilities of audio-based diagnostics for the benefit of public health.
